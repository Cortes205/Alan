# Alan Cortes Portfolio
My personal website to speak about myself, my experiences,
and my projects.

This website is in the very early stages of production but can be accessed
[here](https://alancortes.netlify.app) and will soon have its own domain.

### Purpose
The source code to this website can be used as a template to create a 
website of your own or to simply learn more about working
with React.

## About This Project
Building my personal website has taught me the basics of using
React and many of the available npm libraries and components. I hope to
further pursue my creation of projects using React
and learn to create my own libraries and components.
